# Data warehousing

## OLTP /vs./ OLAP

OLTP: Online transaction processing
OLAP: Online analytical processing

Data warehouses are OLAP solution used for reporting and data analysis

General contents:

- Meta data
- Summary data
- Raw data

Data marts are data collections concerning certain topics or departments and provide clean data for analysis.

# BigQuery

- serverless data warehouse
- combined software and infrastructure
- included features:
  - machine learning
  - geospatial
  - BI
- Separates compute engine and data storage

## Create external tables from google cloud storage

``` sql
CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `workspaceaddon-436615.zoomcamp.green_tripdata2020_ext`
OPTIONS(
  format = 'CSV',
  uris = ['gs://workspaceaddon-436615/green_tripdata_2020-*.csv']
)
```

## Partitioning in BigQuery

- if one or more columns are expected to be used often for filtering, partitioning the table might be an advantage
- reduces cost, as less data need to be processed

``` sql
-- create a non partitioned table within bigquery from external table
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `workspaceaddon-436615.zoomcamp.green_tripdata2020` AS
SELECT * FROM `workspaceaddon-436615.zoomcamp.green_tripdata2020_ext`
```


``` sql 
-- create a partitioned table within bigquery from external table
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `workspaceaddon-436615.zoomcamp.green_tripdata2020_part`
PARTITION by
  DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime) AS
SELECT * FROM `workspaceaddon-436615.zoomcamp.green_tripdata2020_ext`
```

*What is the impact?*

``` sql
-- processes 23 MB of data
SELECT DISTINCT(VendorID)
FROM `workspaceaddon-436615.zoomcamp.green_tripdata2020`
WHERE DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime) BETWEEN '2020-06-01' AND '2020-06-30';
```

``` sql
-- processes < 1 MB of Data
SELECT DISTINCT(VendorID)
FROM `workspaceaddon-436615.zoomcamp.green_tripdata2020_part`
WHERE DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime) BETWEEN '2020-06-01' AND '2020-06-30';
```

```{r}
library(DBI)

# Get the key path from environment variable
key_path <- Sys.getenv("BIGQUERY_KEY_PATH")

# Authenticate using the JSON key file
bigrquery::bq_auth(path = key_path)

con <- dbConnect(
    bigrquery::bigquery(),
    project = "workspaceaddon-436615",
    dataset = "zoomcamp",
    billing = "workspaceaddon-436615"
)
```

```{sql}
--| connection: con
--| output.var: "results"
-- Let's look into the partitons
SELECT table_name, partition_id, total_rows
FROM `zoomcamp.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS`
WHERE table_name = 'green_tripdata2020_part'
ORDER BY total_rows DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::kable(results, format = "pipe")
```

## Combine Clustering with Partitioning

``` sql
-- create a partitioned table within bigquery from external table
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `workspaceaddon-436615.zoomcamp.green_tripdata2020_clus`
PARTITION by
  DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime) 
CLUSTER BY VendorID AS
SELECT * FROM `workspaceaddon-436615.zoomcamp.green_tripdata2020_ext`
```

## Partioning *vs.* Clustering

$$
\begin{array}{|l|l|}
\hline \text { Clustering } & \text { Partitoning } \\
\hline \text { Cost benefit unknown } & \text { Cost known upfront } \\
\hline \begin{array}{l}

\hline \begin{array}{l}
\text { The cardinality of the number of values in a } \\
\text { column or group of columns is large }
\end{array} & \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

BigQuery partitioning divides large tables into smaller segments based on specific criteria like dates or ranges, which improves query performance and reduces costs by scanning less data. 
Clustering, on the other hand, organizes data by sorting and grouping it based on the contents of up to four specified columns, storing related data together for more efficient retrieval. 
While partitioning requires selecting a single column as the partitioning key, clustering can be applied on multiple columns, and the order of clustered columns determines the sort order of the data. Both features can be combined to achieve more finely-grained sorting and further query optimization However, clustering has limitations as it can only be specified during table creation and cannot be modified later.

*When to prefer Clustering over partitioning?*

- too small partitions < 1 GB
- too many partitions
- too frequent data updates across all partiions

## Automatic reclustering

Upon insertion of new data, Bigquery performs automatic reclustering. This is performed in the background and for partitioned tables within the scope of each partition.

# BigQuery best practices

## Cost reduction

The following best practices are specific to BigQuery:

- **Use Partitioned Tables**:  
  
  BigQuery allows you to partition tables by date (or integer range), significantly reducing the amount of data scanned during queries.

- **Cluster Tables**:  
  
  Clustering in BigQuery helps organize data within a table based on specified columns, improving query performance by reducing the data scanned.

- **Use Approximate Aggregation Functions**:  
  
  BigQuery provides functions like `APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT()` that give faster, approximate results with less processing time and lower costs.

- **Leverage Materialized Views**:  
  
  BigQuery supports materialized views, which can store and maintain aggregated results, reducing the cost of repeated computations on large datasets.

- **Use Streaming Inserts Efficiently**:  
  
  BigQuery charges differently for streaming data into tables compared to batch inserts, so recommendations around these methods are specific to BigQuery's pricing model.

- **Materialize Query Results in Stages**:  

  Save intermediate results in tables to avoid recomputation, simplify complex queries, reuse data across multiple queries, and enhance overall query performance in BigQuery.

# BigQuery best practices

## Query performance

Here's a concise bullet point list for BigQuery best practices related to query performance:

## Query performance

- **Use Standard SQL**: Leverage the latest SQL features and optimizations.
- **Select Only Necessary Columns**: Use `SELECT` statements to only retrieve the data you need.
- **Limit the Number of Rows**: Use `LIMIT` to reduce the dataset size if not all rows are required.
- **Partition Tables**: Use table partitioning to improve query times, especially for large datasets.
- **Cluster Tables**: Organize tables by specific columns to enhance performance on filtered queries.
- ** Avoid SELECT \* **: Specify columns instead of using `SELECT *` to reduce data transfer and processing time.
- **Use WITH Clauses**: Break down complex queries into simpler components for better readability and execution.
- **Optimize JOINs**:
  - Use appropriate join types (INNER, LEFT, etc.).
  - Avoid joining large tables if possible.
- **Query Caching**: Take advantage of cached results for repeated queries to save time.
- **Materialized Views**: Use materialized views to precompute and store complex query results.
- **Use Temporary Tables**: Consider storing intermediate results in temporary tables to streamline complex analyses.
- **Monitor Query Performance**: Utilize BigQuery's built-in monitoring tools to identify and troubleshoot slow queries.
- **Reduce Cross-Region Queries**: If possible, ensure datasets and queries operate within the same region to minimize latency and cost. 


### Understanding `WITH` clauses (CTEs) and prepared statements

1. **CTEs vs. Prepared Statements**:
   
   - **CTEs (`WITH` clauses)** are essentially a way to simplify your SQL queries by creating temporary result sets that can be referenced within a single query. They are used to make queries more readable and structured.
    
   - **Prepared Statements** are a feature often used in database programming that allows you to precompile SQL statements with placeholders for parameters. This can enhance performance and security (e.g., against SQL injection attacks) by separating query logic from data.

3. **Execution Context**:
   
   - CTEs are executed as part of the query they are defined within and cannot be reused or executed independently. Each time you run a query containing a CTE, the CTE is recomputed.
   - Prepared statements are compiled and stored in memory, allowing for faster repeated execution with different parameters.

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   
   - If you treat `WITH` clauses like prepared statements (i.e., thinking they can be reused efficiently), you might be misled regarding their performance. CTEs can have overhead since they are re-evaluated for each execution of the main query, especially in queries where CTEs are referenced multiple times.

5. **Code Structure**:
   
   - Treating CTEs like prepared statements may lead to complex queries that become harder to read or maintain. Instead, use CTEs for clarity in breaking down queries, but do not assume they will function with the same efficiency or behavior as prepared statements.

# Internals of Bigquery

## Hardware architecture

Google BigQuery is built on a unique architecture that separates query computation from data storage, enabling high efficiency and scalability. This architecture leverages:

- **Colossus Storage**: This is Google's distributed file system designed for high-performance storage of large datasets. Colossus allows BigQuery to manage and store massive amounts of data across multiple locations, ensuring durability and availability. Data is stored in a columnar format, which enhances compression and retrieval efficiency, especially for analytical queries.

- **Jupiter Network**: Jupiter is Google's next-generation data center network that provides the high-speed interconnectivity required to transfer data between computing resources and storage systems. It enables BigQuery to efficiently handle large-scale data processing by facilitating quick access to data stored in Colossus. The low-latency, high-bandwidth capabilities of Jupiter allow for rapid execution of complex queries, further boosting performance for users.

Together, Colossus Storage and Jupiter Network enable BigQuery to deliver a serverless, scalable, and efficient data warehousing solution suitable for large-scale analytics and real-time data processing.

## Column-oriented *vs.* record-oriented storage

Column-oriented storage organizes data by columns rather than rows, allowing for efficient access and compression of similar data types. This structure is particularly beneficial for analytical queries that require operations on large datasets and often involve aggregations, as it significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be read from disk, making it ideal for read-heavy workloads and analytics applications.

On the other hand, record-oriented storage structures data by rows, storing all attributes of a record together. This format is advantageous for transaction processing and scenarios where complete records are accessed frequently, such as in online transaction processing (OLTP) systems. It improves performance for operations that involve inserting, updating, or reading entire records, making it a suitable choice for real-time applications that require quick access to individual records.

## Internal query processing - DREMEL

Dremel is a distributed query system developed by Google, designed for running fast and interactive SQL queries on large datasets. Here’s a concise explanation of how Dremel computes the result of a query:

1. **Parsing and Query Planning**: When a query is submitted, Dremel first parses the SQL statement to create a query execution plan. This includes analyzing the query structure, validating the syntax, and optimizing the execution path based on the schema and available resources.

2. **Columnar Storage**: Dremel accesses data stored in a columnar format, which allows it to read only relevant columns for the query, significantly reducing the amount of data processed and improving performance.

3. **Tree Architecture**: Dremel employs a tree-like architecture with multiple levels of workers. The root of the tree is responsible for receiving the query and distributing it to child nodes. Each node may further distribute tasks to its own children, allowing for massive parallel processing.

4. **Execution**: Each worker node executes its part of the query using a combination of execution strategies, including selective reading, filtering, and aggregating data. The computation is highly parallelized, taking advantage of multiple processors to speed up the query execution.

5. **Result Aggregation**: As the worker nodes complete their tasks, they send intermediate results back to their parent nodes. This process continues up the tree, with nodes aggregating results until the final output is returned to the root node.

6. **Final Output**: The root node compiles the results from all child nodes and returns the final result to the user. This approach ensures that Dremel can handle large-scale queries efficiently, even over vast datasets.

# Machine learning using BigQuery

Google BigQuery offers powerful machine learning capabilities through BigQuery ML (BigQuery Machine Learning), which allows you to build and deploy machine learning models directly within the BigQuery environment using SQL queries. This makes it accessible for data analysts and data scientists who may not be familiar with programming in Python or R.

### Key Features
- **In-database Processing**: Train models directly on large datasets without the need for data export.
- **Familiar SQL Interface**: Users can leverage standard SQL syntax to create and interact with machine learning models.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with other Google Cloud services, making it easy to manage data and models.

### Code Examples

1. **Creating a Model**:
   To create a linear regression model, you can use the following SQL statement:

   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `your_project_id.your_dataset.your_model`
   OPTIONS(
    model_type='linear_reg',
    input_label_cols=["target"],
    DATA_SPLIT_METHOD='AUTO_SPLIT'
    ) AS
   SELECT
     feature1,
     feature2,
     target
   FROM
     `your_project_id.your_dataset.your_table`;
   ```

2. **Evaluating a Model**:
   After the model is created, you can evaluate its performance:

   ```sql
   SELECT
     *
   FROM
     ML.EVALUATE(MODEL `your_project_id.your_dataset.your_model`,
     (
       SELECT
         feature1,
         feature2,
         target
       FROM
         `your_project_id.your_dataset.your_table`));
   ```

3. **Making Predictions**:
   Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new data:

   ```sql
   SELECT
     *
   FROM
     ML.PREDICT(MODEL `your_project_id.your_dataset.your_model`,
     (
       SELECT
         feature1,
         feature2
       FROM
         `your_project_id.your_dataset.new_data_table`));
   ```

### Supported Algorithms
BigQuery ML supports several algorithms, including linear regression, logistic regression, K-means clustering, and various types of neural networks, making it versatile for numerous use cases.

### Conclusion
Google BigQuery ML simplifies the process of building and deploying machine learning models, allowing users to harness the power of Google Cloud's big data capabilities with their existing SQL skills. This integration is particularly useful for organizations looking to leverage data for predictive analytics without the overhead of complex machine learning infrastructure.'

## Deployment
Here's a concise guide to deploy a BigQuery ML model with TensorFlow Serving:

Prep step - Get the model out of BigQuery

There are 3 main ways to export a BigQuery ML model to a Cloud Storage bucket:

1. Using the Console:
```bash
- Open BigQuery in Google Cloud Console
- Navigate to Resources > Your Project > Dataset
- Click on your model
- Click "Export Model"
- Select Cloud Storage location
- Click "Export"
```

2. Using SQL:
```sql
EXPORT MODEL `myproject.mydataset.mymodel` 
OPTIONS(URI = 'gs://bucket/path/to/saved_model/')
```

3. Using bq command-line:
```bash
bq extract --model \
'mydataset.mymodel' \
gs://example-bucket/mymodel_folder
```

The exported model will be in TensorFlow SavedModel format by default[1]. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the BigQuery ML model and write to the Cloud Storage bucket[1]. The BigQuery dataset and the Cloud Storage bucket must be in the same location[1].
